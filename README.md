## Usage

### Windows

 * Download and install https://github.com/uav4geo/Thermal-Tools/releases/download/v1.1.0/Thermal_Tools_Setup.exe

### Linux

 * Download https://github.com/uav4geo/Thermal-Tools/releases/download/v1.1.0/Thermal_Tools.AppImage
 * Run: `chmod +x ./Thermal_Tools.AppImage && ./Thermal_Tools.AppImage`

Afterwards:

 * Select a folder with thermal images captured with a DJI drone
 * Optionally set environment parameters
